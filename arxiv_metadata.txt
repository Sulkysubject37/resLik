Title: Reliability Is a System Property: The Representation-Level Control Surfaces (RLCS) Paradigm
Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in open-world environments frequently encounter inputs that violate their training assumptions, leading to silent failures, overconfident predictions, and catastrophic system instability. Current mitigation strategies primarily treat reliability as a property to be learned by the model, through robust training, domain adaptation, or epistemic uncertainty estimation. This work argues that this assumption is structurally flawed for safety-critical and high-throughput systems. Reliability is not an emergent property of learning, but a managed property of systems. This paper introduces Representation-Level Control Surfaces (RLCS), a systems architecture that embeds lightweight, deterministic reliability sensing directly into the latent feature spaces of learned models. RLCS enforces a strict separation between sensing (measuring consistency), signaling (mapping measures to recommendations), and acting (executing decisions), preventing the conflation of statistical inference with execution policy. This work presents resLik (Residual Likelihood Sensor), the reference instantiation of the RLCS sensing layer, alongside companion sensors for temporal and cross-view consistency. Through multi-domain demonstrations in robotics, applied AI, and data systems, this work shows that RLCS enables the construction of "self-aware" pipelines that can deterministically detect distribution shifts, temporal shocks, and modal conflicts without requiring model retraining, complex ensemble fusion, or prohibitive computational overhead.
