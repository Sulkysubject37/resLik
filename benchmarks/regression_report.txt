Regression Report (Phase 4.5)
Date: 2026-01-12

Objective: Verify that introducing dead-zone gating (tau) did not break existing benchmarks.

1. Stability Under Noise
   - Status: PASS
   - Behavior: Still effectively dampens large noise.
   - Note: Uses default tau=0.05.

2. Calibration Alignment
   - Status: PASS
   - Correlation: rho ~ 0.73 (Unchanged).

3. Distribution Shift
   - Status: PASS
   - Sensitivity: Still detects shift (Gate 0.15 vs 0.92).

Conclusion:
The introduction of the dead-zone parameter is safe.
It enables fixing the ablation failure (requires tau ~ 0.8) without forcing a regression on other tasks (which work fine with lower tau).
User tuning of tau is the key to balancing these trade-offs.
